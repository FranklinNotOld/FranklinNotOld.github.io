												The rapid advancement of internet technology has shifted communication from offline to online platforms, necessitating reliable authentication methods to establish trust between individuals, 
												businesses, and institutions. Given the importance of facial features in personal identification, facial recognition technology has become an essential tool for ensuring security in various 
												sectors, including finance, security, and government.

									The secure facial recognition system presented in this project is designed with several key modules, each playing a crucial role in ensuring robust and accurate performance against various types of facial spoofing attacks. 
									Below, we describe the specific implementation details of these modules.
									</p>
									
									<p style="font-size: 16px;">
										<ul>
											<p style="font-size: 16px;">
												<div class="container">
													<div class="text-container">
														<li style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Extended Functionality Module:</b> This module includes Human Pose Estimation and Fine-Grained Image Segmentation. The Human Pose Estimation is powered by an Openpose-based algorithm, 
															which helps identify key body points to verify whether the detected person is a live individual. The Image Segmentation utilizes an enhanced U2Net model, which is lightweight yet capable of capturing detailed features, making it suitable for real-time segmentation tasks.</li>

											<p style="font-size: 16px;">
												<div class="container">
													<div class="text-container">
														<li style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Face Authentication Module:</b> This module uses the FaceNet-KD model, which is a knowledge-distilled version of the original FaceNet. 
															The distillation process reduces the model's size while retaining high accuracy, making it more efficient for real-time applications. It first performs face segmentation using BlazeNet and then extracts facial features to compare similarity, 
															thereby ensuring robust identification even in varying lighting conditions and backgrounds.</li>

												</div>
											</p>
											
											<li style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Forgery Detection Module:</b> This module is divided into two sub-modules: Traditional Forgery Detection and Deepfake Detection. The Traditional Forgery Detection uses the FAS (Face Anti-Spoofing) model to defend 
												against attacks such as printed photos or 3D masks. The Deepfake Detection sub-module employs an optimized Capsule Network that integrates VGG-16p as the feature extractor, followed by dynamic routing algorithms to accurately detect AI-generated fake faces, 
												ensuring high precision and fast processing.</li>

											<li style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Frontend and Backend Module:</b> The system's frontend offers a user-friendly interface for uploading images or videos and visualizing the results. The backend manages data processing, 
												interfaces with the machine learning models, and returns the authentication results. This module is designed to provide a seamless user experience while ensuring high security and accuracy.</li>
