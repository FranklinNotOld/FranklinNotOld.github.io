								<p style="font-size: 16px;">The GNN4Route project tackles the significant challenges of fine-grained IP geolocation by introducing a novel framework that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). 
									This project addresses the limitations of traditional IP geolocation methods, which often struggle with inaccuracies due to incomplete data, network complexity, 
									and the dynamic nature of internet topologies.</p>

								<p style="font-size: 16px;">The background of this project is rooted in the growing demand for precise IP geolocation across various industries, such as targeted advertising, fraud prevention,
									 and logistics management. Traditional methods, which include database lookups and basic network measurements, often fall short in providing accurate and reliable geolocation results, 
									 particularly at the street level. The GNN4Route project was developed to overcome these limitations and achieve more accurate geolocation results.</p>
